JavaScript objects are internally represented as dictionaries or hash maps in memory, allowing for fast property access. Property lookup involves traversing this internal map, enabling efficient retrieval of values. Memory management techniques, such as garbage collection, ensure optimal usage of memory. Understanding these internals empowers developers to write efficient and reliable code, leveraging JavaScript's powerful object model for effective web development.
